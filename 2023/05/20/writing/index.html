Therefore, alternative ways of reducing crime can address the root causes of crime and help offenders reintegrate into society.</span><br><span class="line">	In my opinion, I agree with the second view that alternative ways </span><br><span class="line">	of reducing crime are preferable to longer prison sentences. </span><br><span class="line">I think that longer prison sentences are not a solution to crime but a symptom of a deeper social problem. </span><br><span class="line">I believe that crime can be reduced by providing more opportunities and support for disadvantaged groups, </span><br><span class="line">such as education, employment, health care, and counseling. </span><br><span class="line">I also think that crime can be reduced by promoting restorative justice and community service, </span><br><span class="line">which can foster empathy and responsibility among offenders and victims. </span><br><span class="line">I believe that these measures can prevent crime in the long term and create a safer and more harmonious society.</span><br><span class="line">	In conclusion, there are different views on how to reduce crime in society. </span><br><span class="line">Some people support longer prison sentences while others favor alternative ways of reducing crime. </span><br><span class="line">I have discussed both views and given my opinion. </span><br><span class="line">I think that alternative ways of reducing crime are more effective </span><br><span class="line">and humane than longer prison sentences.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

We have a moral obligation to respect and care for other forms of life, </span><br><span class="line">and to avoid causing them unnecessary harm or suffering²⁴. </span><br><span class="line">Saving land for endangered animals is a way of showing our respect and compassion for other living beings, </span><br><span class="line">and acknowledging their inherent worth.</span><br><span class="line">	Thirdly, saving land for endangered animals does not mean neglecting human needs for farmland, </span><br><span class="line">housing, and industry. It means finding **sustainable and equitable ways** to meet those needs </span><br><span class="line">without compromising the needs of other species or future generations. </span><br><span class="line">It means using resources wisely and efficiently, reducing waste and pollution, promoting renewable energy and green technology, </span><br><span class="line">supporting local communities and indigenous peoples, and planning development with respect for nature¹⁴. </span><br><span class="line">It means recognizing that human well-being depends on the well-being of nature³. </span><br><span class="line">Saving land for endangered animals is not a zero-sum game, where one side wins and the other loses. </span><br><span class="line">It is a win-win situation, where both humans and animals can coexist and thrive.</span><br><span class="line">	In conclusion, I think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry </span><br><span class="line">are not more important than saving land for endangered animals. I think that both are important and interrelated, </span><br><span class="line">and that we need to find a balance between them that ensures the survival and flourishing of all life on Earth. </span><br><span class="line">Saving land for endangered animals is more important than human needs for farmland, housing, and industry, </span><br><span class="line">because it means preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, protecting intrinsic value and animal rights, </span><br><span class="line">and finding sustainable and equitable solutions for human development.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

Here is a possible outline:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Introduction: Introduce the topic and state your thesis statement. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; The issue of whether boys and girls should be educated in separate or mixed schools has been debated for a long time. Some people argue that single-sex education can provide a more conducive learning environment and avoid distractions, while others contend that co-education can foster social skills and diversity. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my own opinion.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 1: Explain the advantages of single-sex education and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; One of the main benefits of single-sex education is that it can cater to the different learning styles and preferences of boys and girls. According to some studies, boys tend to be more active and competitive, while girls tend to be more cooperative and expressive. Therefore, separate schools can offer more tailored curricula and teaching methods that suit the needs and interests of each gender. For instance, boys may benefit from more hands-on activities and challenges, while girls may enjoy more discussions and creative projects.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 2: Explain the disadvantages of single-sex education and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; However, single-sex education also has some drawbacks that cannot be ignored. One of the main disadvantages is that it can limit the exposure and interaction of boys and girls to each other and to different perspectives. This may result in stereotypes, prejudices, and social awkwardness that can hinder their personal and professional development. For example, boys may lack empathy and communication skills, while girls may lack confidence and leadership skills.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 3: Explain the advantages of mixed education and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; On the other hand, mixed education can offer many advantages that outweigh the disadvantages of single-sex education. One of the main advantages is that it can promote social skills and diversity among boys and girls. By learning and working together in a mixed environment, they can develop respect, tolerance, and cooperation that are essential for living in a multicultural society. For example, they can learn from each other&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, share their opinions and experiences, and support each other&#x27;s goals.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 4: Explain the disadvantages of mixed education and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; Nevertheless, mixed education also has some challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is that it can create distractions and peer pressure that can affect the academic performance and well-being of boys and girls. According to some studies, boys tend to be more influenced by their peers than by their teachers, while girls tend to be more affected by their appearance than by their abilities. Therefore, mixed schools need to provide adequate guidance and counseling to help students cope with these issues. For instance, they can encourage positive role models, foster self-esteem, and prevent bullying.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Conclusion: Summarize the main points and restate your opinion. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; In conclusion, both single-sex and mixed education have their own merits and demerits that should be considered carefully. In my opinion, mixed education is more beneficial than single-sex education because it can prepare boys and girls for the real world better. However, I also believe that the quality of education depends more on the teachers, students, parents, and society than on the gender composition of the schools.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

Here is a possible outline:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Introduction: Introduce the topic and state your thesis statement. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; The role of parents and schools in teaching children how to be good members of society is a controversial issue. Some people believe that parents have the primary responsibility and influence, while others argue that schools have a more important function and impact. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my own opinion.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 1: Explain the advantages of parents teaching children and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; One of the main advantages of parents teaching children is that they can instill moral values and social norms from an early age. Parents are the first and most constant teachers of their children, and they can shape their character and behavior through their words and actions. For example, parents can teach their children to be honest, respectful, compassionate, and responsible by setting good examples and providing guidance and feedback.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 2: Explain the disadvantages of parents teaching children and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; However, parents teaching children also has some limitations that cannot be overlooked. One of the main limitations is that parents may not have the necessary skills and knowledge to teach their children effectively and comprehensively. Parents may have different levels of education, experience, and background, and they may not be able to cover all the aspects and topics that are relevant for their children&#x27;s development. For example, parents may not be able to teach their children about different cultures, religions, or perspectives that are essential for living in a diverse society.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 3: Explain the advantages of schools teaching children and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; On the other hand, schools teaching children can offer many benefits that complement the disadvantages of parents teaching children. One of the main benefits is that schools can provide a structured and systematic curriculum and environment that can enhance the learning outcomes and experiences of children. Schools have qualified and trained teachers who can teach various subjects and skills that are important for children&#x27;s academic and social growth. For example, schools can teach children about history, science, art, language, math, critical thinking, communication, teamwork, and more.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Body paragraph 4: Explain the disadvantages of schools teaching children and provide some examples or evidence. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; Nevertheless, schools teaching children also has some challenges that need to be overcome. One of the main challenges is that schools may not be able to address the individual needs and interests of each child. Schools have large and diverse classes that may make it difficult for teachers to cater to the different abilities, personalities, and backgrounds of their students. Therefore, schools need to provide adequate support and resources to help students achieve their full potential. For example, schools can offer extra classes, counseling, clubs, activities, and more.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- Conclusion: Summarize the main points and restate your opinion. For example:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; In conclusion, both parents and schools have their own roles and responsibilities in teaching children how to be good members of society. In my opinion, both are equally important and should work together to provide the best education for children. However, I also believe that the ultimate goal of education is to help children become independent and responsible individuals who can make their own decisions and contributions to society.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
